# Dune Campaign Chronicle (Astro)

A Dune-inspired campaign tracker now built with **Astro** and styled with a richer Arrakis theme, including a custom house sigil.

## Why the previous server showed "Bad Request"

This project is now an Astro app (not just plain static files), so use Astro's development server rather than a random static server command.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321`.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
